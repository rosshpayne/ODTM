Distributed Operation Manager (DOM) for Oracle

DOM provides a simple framework and execution engine to manage the execution of your complex database maintenance operations across a network of Oracle database instances from a central server, called the DOM-server, in a safe, restartable and scalable fashion.

Complex database operations are usually composed of mulitple SQL statements and/or stored procedure calls applied to one or more database objects (tables, indexes, partitions etc) where each step must complete successfuly before proceeding to the next step. Alternatively, an operation may involve running identical steps over multiple Oracle instances concurrently.  Eitherway, the more complex an operation the easier it becomes to justify the cost of configuring DOM to do it.

The DOM framework requires each database operation be represented as a number of repeatable tasks, each implemented as a stored procedure contained in a single PL/SQL package, combined with a table containing state information to guarantee safe restarting of a failed operation.

* Usage example	

DOM performs two major tasks, it centralises all scheduling and logging of database operations and enables full restartability of an operation.

A typically scenario that demonstrates restartability of an operation is a follows:

	1.  Start operation using PL/SQL API
		
		SQL> execute DOM$MAIN.run_op ( 12, 1)

            where 12 is the operation_id which defines a 7 step operation say.
            and 1 is the environment_id such as PRODUCTION, UAT or TEST with its associated db instances.

	2. Operation fails with a space issue (say) at task 4. DOM aborts and writes the error to various log tables.  
	   There remains task 4 plus 3 other tasks to complete however.
       
           Review the reasons for the failure referencing one or all of the following log tables:

		SQL>  select * from DOM$run_log  where id = DOM$MAIN.get_run_id(17,1)
		SQL>  select * from DOM$task_log where run_id = DOM$MAIN.get_run_id(17,1)
		SQL>  select * from DOM$sql_log  where task_log_id = g_task_log_id
	

 	3.   Fix the space issue 
    
   	4.   Restart the operation using the SQL from step 1.   
    
  	     DOM will automatically run the remaining tasks starting at task 4.

* The DOM architecture:

DOM employees a single server with multiple clients model. Further:

        + DOM-server  -  schema which contains the DOM repository, all your code and state tables.
                         DOM executes operation from this server and initiates all operations remotely 
                         across DOM-clients.
                         (In the code base this is referred as the MAIN server) 
        + DOM-clients -  one client for each database instance that executes a task in an operation.  
                         Requires a DOM-client schema and DOM$bootstrap package.
                         All DOM-clients should be accessible to the DOM-Server via db-links. 
                         The DOM-server should also be accessible to the DOM-client via a db-link.
                         The DOM-server will remotely install your operation package and state table on the client 
                         at runtime during the initialisation phase of each operation.
                         
DOM features include:

* central Data Repository

The repository defines the data required to drive DOMs execution of database operation across the enterprise. Such information includes but is not limited to:

    + database environments types (dev,test,prod etc)
    + the Oracle instances that belong to those environments
    + the package and SPs that defines the database operation
    + which operations run across which Oracle instances
    + user defined parameters (key-value pairs) to drive your code logic 
    + detailed runtime logging of all operations, tasks and SQL

* Self installing

The DOM-server is responsible for installing your package code, representing the repeatable tasks in an operation, across each of the associated DOM-clientis (usually just one) prior to initiating the operation on each db instance.

* secure implementation

The DOM repository and runtime operations are conducted in their own dedicated database schemas which follow minimum privileges model. The DOM server schema has privileges to maintain the repository while each remote instance has a DOM schema with sufficient privileges (usually at a DBA level) to perform the database operations required.

* a single code repository for your database packages.

All your pacakges are installed or upgraded on the DOM repository only.  At runtime DOM will remotely copy the relevant package to each database instance involved in the operation. Note: the repository holds only the package code not any of its dependent objects.

* central runtime logging of your operation down to the SQL level

Each operation generates detailed logging back to the central DOM-server down to the SQL level.  Such metrics include the execution time for the operation, its tasks and associated SQL, status of each, the SQL text and number of parallel threads used and number of rows processed where appropriate.

* Simple Framework 

DOM's framework requires that for each operation you must create a "state" table and define three stored procedures in your operatino package. 
The table is used to hold operation state between execution of each repeatable task defined in the operation package. 
The three manadatory procedures are:

        + initial
        + final
        + iterator
        
See code examples for further descriptions.

* Simple and safe restartability

Should an operation fail DOM will log the error in the central repository. Once you have fixed the reason for the error the DOM administrator merely issues the same command used to start the operation.  DOM will restart the operation from the failed task.
