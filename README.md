DOM is a framework and centralised execution environment designed to run your complex Oracle database operations (e.g. purge data, reorg tables/indexes)
in a reliable, restartable and scalable fashion across hundreds of database instances at a time.

A database opertion consists of an ordered set of restartable tasks, each implemented by a stored procedues you have written.
DOM executes each task concurrently across each database instances you have associated with the operation.  

DOM logs all operations by task and SQL.
