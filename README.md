DOM provides a simple framework and execution engine for the purpose of running your complex database maintenance operations across a network of Oracle database instances from a central server, call the DOM-server, in a safe, restartable and scalable fashion.
Complex database operations are usually made up ot mulitple steps each of which may take many minutes to run and need to complete before proceeding to the next step or they may be involve identical steps to be execute over many Oracle instances.  Eitherway, the more complex the operation the easy it is to justify using DOM.

Each database operation is represented as an ordered set of stored procedures calls defined in a single PL/SQL package that you develop utilising DOM’s simple framework to guarantee safe restarting of a failed operation while providing logging of all operations to the DOM server.

DOM features include:

* a central Data Repository

The repository defines the data required by DOM to drive the execution of each database operation across your enterprise. Such information includes but is not limited to:

    + database environments types (dev,test,prod etc)
    + the Oracle instances that belong to those environments
    + the package and SPs that defines the database operation
    + which operations run across which Oracle instances
    + user defined parameters (key-value pairs) to drive your code logic 
    + detailed runtime logging of all operations, tasks and SQL

* secure implementation

The DOM repository and runtime operations are conducted in their own dedicated database schemas with minimum privileges. The DOM server schema has privileges to maintain the repository while each remote instance has a DOM schema with sufficient privileges (usually at a DBA level) to perform the database operations required.

* a single code repository for your database packages.

Each SP package is initially saved to the DOM repository.  At runtime DOM will copy the package to each remote database instance involved in the operation. Note: the repository holds only the package code not any of its dependent objects.

* a central runtime logging of your operation down to the SQL level

DOM logs all runtime metrics for each operation across each remote instance and for each of the tasks associated with an operation down to the SQL level.  Such metrics include the execution time for the operation, its tasks and associated SQL, status of each, the SQL text and number of parallel threads used and number of rows processed where appropriate.

* Concurrent processing

For each operation DOM issues a separate Oracle scheduler job on the DOM server for each of the database instances assigned to the operation.  Each job in turn executes the DOM code responsible for remotely executing the uncompleted SP on its assigned Oracle instance

* Simple Framework 

DOM provides a framework which your packages should use to get all the benefits of flexibility of operation, re-startability and logging.  

* Simple and safe restartability

Should an operation fail DOM will log the error in the central repository. Once you have fixed the reason for the error the DOM administrator merely has to issue the same command used to start the operation.  DOM will restart the operation from the failed task.
